# Exploratory-analysis-on-Housing-price-dataset
Data analysis of the House Prices data set

Main things that are done in the notebook is something like:
    Understanding the problem. We'll look at each variable and do a philosophical analysis of their meaning and its importance to this problem.
    Univariable study. We'll just focus on the dependent variable ('SalePrice') and try to learn a little bit more about it.
    Multivariate study. We'll try to understand how the dependent variable and the independent variables relate to each other.
    Basic cleaning. We'll clean the data set and handle the missing data, outliers, and categorical variables.
    Test assumptions. We'll check if our data meets the assumptions required by most multivariate techniques.
